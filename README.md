# Blight_Assay_Image_Analysis
Pipeline for processing and visualizing imaging data from blight assay and imaging software.

Blight_Assay_Image_Analysis_v1.1.R processes and visualizes imaging software data of blight assays.

In Vitro Blight Assay Show Image.R quickly renders any images in question for validation of the imaging/analysis software.

Both apps require in their working directory 'All_Data_Renamed/All_Data/' to source raw data.

    If raw data has naming errors, rename_files.qmd may be of use.
